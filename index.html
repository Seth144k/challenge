<H2>How I made a website with html in a week and why</H2>

<p>
<centerleft>Coding and programming are things everybody wants to do but just doesnt want to put in time and work to master it especially if its more complex languages like c++ (which I am also learning)</centerleft>
<p>
<H3>Why am I pushing myself to make this so quick?</H3>
<body>Well to answer this question it's because I want to test my skills and what I know so far. The thing that I feel like with people is that they find something that they dont like and then they just stop</body>
<p>
  I am not going to stop learning and developing ever
  <p>
    Another reason why I want to do this is because I like challenges and coding so I guess that's why
    <p>
      The last reason why is because in my opinion you cant get something done if you dont <b>actually</b> do it. And giving myself a time limit is actually helping because I have a challenge and video to make and it forces me to actually finish it. You follow?
      <h3>How did I learn html and for how long</h3>
      <body>I've been watching a lot of youtube videos to kind of get myself familiarized with html, but I used this app you can download called "Mimo" I'll leave a download <a
        href="https://getmimo.com/">
        <u>here</u></a>
        As to how long I have been actually learning html I'd say it's only been about a week. But in a week I learned <b><I>ALOT</I></b>

<h3>What do I plan to do in the future and what is my real dream</h3>
Well... my real dream for when I get older is to work as a lead programmer at some kind of AAA game development studio at Nintendo or something. 
<p>
  Just letting you know I already know that a programming language like html or even html 5 wont get me into game developing companys of any kind. I am going to try and learn c++ because thats what most developers use.
  <h3>Is html easy?</h3>
  Ok so, I'm going to put it like this: html is easy once you get the hang of it but even if you do, it has varying levels of difficulty. I dont even know how to use borders or use CSS or Javascript in my code yet.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Will I make a youtube tutorial series on how to code in html?</h3>
  In the future I <b>DEFINITLY</b> will! I want to show everyone how easy it can be to do something not everyone can say that they do like for instance, making a whole website from scratch or even saying that you have some knowledge of a programming language in general. To be able to see your dreams come to true and to be able to do something like this on your own is incredible.
  <p>
    Sorry I got a little off topic but seriously I would totally make a series on how to do things like this. I might do this in the future sometime maybe when I get a little more...knowledge or advancements but be expecting that in the future
    If you guys really want me to make a tutorial series on this then comment on this video! If I get enough comments I might actually do it now and have you guys learn with me. If I start learning c++ and I make a video now then if i learn c++ you guys will be learning with me
